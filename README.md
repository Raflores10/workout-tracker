## User Story
```md
As a regular gym-goer,
I want an easy, streamlined website
So that I can easily track my core lifts.
```
## Description
The motivation behind this project was to create an application that would be more user friendly than others. Being a regular gym-goer, I want to track how much I am lifting on bench press, squat, and deadlift. Sometimes in the gym we plateau into a regular weight with only the reps changing, this can be difficult to grasp that we are still progressing even though it might not seem like it. What we need is a way to calculate what our "One-Rep Max" is. Using various backend technologies including: Node.js, Express, Handlebars, and Sequelize amongst others, we want a website that can do these calculations for us.

This solves the need of an individual who is seemingly stuck at a certain weight. This motivational tool can be just enough to reach over that plateau.

## Acceptance Criteria
```md
GIVEN workout tracker website
WHEN I visit the webpage
THEN I am presented with an option to sign up.
WHEN I visit the webpage
THEN I am presented with the option to log in. 
WHEN I log in
THEN I am presented with the option to choose a specific workout.
WHEN I click on the "Bench" button, 
THEN I am taken to another page where I can input my reps and weight.
WHEN I enter in that data, 
THEN I am taken to a records page and shown my "One-Rep-Max"
WHEN I log out,
THEN I am no longer able to see my data.
```
## My Task
To create a functional and streamlined workout tracker website than can calculate and store our "One-Rep-Max" data.

## Installation
Begin at the GitHub repository that holds the code:
https://github.com/Raflores10/workout-tracker

Once you are at the correct repository, click on the green "<> Code" button and select "SSH" under the "Local" tab.

Copy the SSH key to your clipboard and navigate to your terminal.

Once you are in your terminal, navigate to the directory of which you would like to clone this repository.

When you are at the destination you would like to clone, follow through with the git cloning procedures as you would normally.

## Usage
When arriving at the website, users will be presented with a sign up page. Once signed up, the user will be directed to the homepage. Once the user selects an options, they are then able to enter in their workout data. Once entered, the user is shown their "One-Rep Max" and taken to their records page. If the user clicks the logout button, they are taken to the login page.

A .env file will be necessary.
